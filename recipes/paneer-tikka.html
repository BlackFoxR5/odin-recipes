    <h2>How to Make Paneer-Tikka</h2>
    <p>One of my most favourite meals in the world is the iconic North Indian dish, Restaurant-Style Paneer Tikka.
        When this street food gem is served alongside lemon wedges, salad and mint and coriander chutney, nothing else comes close.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g paneer</li>
        <li>2 large onion</li>
        <li>2 bell pepper</li>
        <li>150g yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp roasted gram flour</li>
        <li>4 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced ginger</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tbps ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground fennel</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>6 green cardamom seeds</li>
        <li>2 tbsp kasuri methi</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>100ml mustard oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the paneer into cubes, about 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm. 
            Soak the cubes in a bowl of boiling hot water (skip this step if using homemade paneer) whilst you make prepare 
            the rest of the vegetables for the tikka and make the marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Core and de-seed the peppers and cut them into pieces, about the same size as the paneer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Peel the onions and slice them into quarters, or roughly the same size as the peppers and paneer. 
            Peel the layers of the onions apart to separate into 'petals'.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the yoghurt, roasted gram flour, Kashmiri chilli powder, cumin, coriander, fennel, black pepper, 
            smoked paprika, cardamom, turmeric, kasoori methi, salt, lemon juice, garlic and ginger. Whisk well. Heat the mustard oil in a 
            small saucepan until smoking hot. Carefully pour the hot oil over the yoghurt mixture. Whisk again until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the paneer, peppers and onions to the prepared marinade and toss well to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Skewer the paneer and vegetables onto oven-safe kebab skewers (I use metal ones). Alternate the ingredients according to your preference.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the skewers over an oven tray, resting the exposed bottom and top of the skewer on the lip of the tray so the ingredients are 
            suspended and not touching the tray. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 220°C/425°F fan for 15-18 minutes. Keep an eye on them to 
            ensure they do not burn.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can finish by scorching the kebabs over an open flame like I do (see video), or under the grill. This will give the tikka a 
            restaurant-like flavour, as if they have been cooked in a tandoor (clay oven).
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot with naan and mint yoghurt or green coriander chutney.
        </li>
    </ol>
